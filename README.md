# Microprocessors and Assembly Course

## Course Overview
These are my codes and Proteus projects for the "Microprocessors and Assembly" course.

In this course, `Intel 8086` is used as a microprocessor and the instructions of this processor are taught. The microprocessor part of this course uses `Proteus (Version 8.6.SP2)`. If you want to run the projects, make sure that the version is at least `8.6.SP2`.

## Course Structure
- **Microprocessor Used:** Intel 8086
- **Simulation Tool:** Proteus (Version 8.6.SP2)

### Important Note:
To run the course projects successfully, ensure you have at least Proteus Version 8.6.SP2 installed.

### Labs Overview:
The labs in this course start from Lab 5, as the first four labs, which cover basic Assembly language, are waived for students who have completed the prior Assembly course. The labs focus on applying microprocessor principles using Intel 8086.

Each lab includes:
- A related question or objective.
- A Proteus project file demonstrating the solution.
- Assembly code snippets used within Proteus.
- Video narrations explaining the lab and the solution.
